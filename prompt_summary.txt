# Whisper API: Rust-based Audio Transcription Service

## Architecture Overview
The Whisper API is a high-performance HTTP service built in Rust using Actix-web that provides audio transcription via WhisperX. It implements a queue-based architecture with modular components that manage concurrent requests while optimizing resource usage through configurable sequential or parallel processing.

## Core Components
- **HTTP Handler**: Receives requests, validates parameters, stores audio files
- **Queue Manager**: Manages transcription jobs in FIFO order with configurable concurrency
- **WhisperX Integration**: Executes transcription with support for multiple parameters
- **Authentication System**: Token-based access control (configurable)

## Key Features
- RESTful API with both synchronous and asynchronous transcription modes
- Configurable audio processing device (CPU/CUDA) with device selection
- Support for speaker diarization with HuggingFace token handling
- Comprehensive job lifecycle management (submission, monitoring, retrieval, cancellation)
- Multiple output formats (srt, vtt, txt, tsv, json)
- Automatic file cleanup and privacy protection
- Queue position tracking with intelligent wait time estimation
- Flexible configuration via TOML file and environment variables
- UUID-based job isolation for security

## Configuration Options
- Processing device: `WHISPER_DEVICE` (cuda/cpu) and `WHISPER_DEVICE_INDEX` (GPU selection)
- Concurrency: `ENABLE_CONCURRENCY` and `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`
- Authentication: `ENABLE_AUTHORIZATION`
- Resource limits: `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `SYNC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- File management: `WHISPER_TMP_FILES`, `WHISPER_OUTPUT_DIR`, `WHISPER_JOB_RETENTION_HOURS`

## API Endpoints
- `POST /transcription`: Submit audio for transcription
- `GET /transcription/{job_id}`: Check job status with queue position
- `GET /transcription/{job_id}/result`: Retrieve completed transcription
- `DELETE /transcription/{job_id}`: Cancel pending job

## Technical Implementation
- Thread-safe queue management with `Arc<Mutex<>>` and Tokio async runtime
- Intelligent resource allocation based on processing mode
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Automatic job expiration and cleanup system
- Multi-layered file security and privacy protection

## Deployment Requirements
- Rust with Tokio async runtime
- WhisperX with Python environment
- GPU support (optional, can run on CPU)
- Configuration file for environment-specific settings
- Optional HuggingFace token for speaker diarization

## Limitations and Future Enhancements
- Currently implements basic token verification
- Single-instance design (no distributed queuing)
- Maximum file size limited to 512MB by default
